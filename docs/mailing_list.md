The WEKA Mailing list can be found here:

* [List](https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/lists/weka-users) for subscribing/unsubscribing to the list.
* [Archives](https://sourceforge.net/p/weka/mailman/weka-users/) for searching previous posted messages.


Before posting, please read the [mailing list etiquette](https://ml.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka/mailinglist_etiquette.html).

Once you have subscribed to the list (a moderator may have to approve your request), you can send posts to the list
using the following email address:

```

**NB:** The mailing list moved to Sourceforge.net in mid-December 2024, due to
the university mailman server being decommissioned. You can find the old archives [on this mirror](https://marc.info/?l=wekalist).
