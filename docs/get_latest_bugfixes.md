Weka is actively developed, that means that bugs are fixed and new functionality is added (only to the developer version) all the time. Every now and then (about every 6-12 months), when there was a sufficiently large number of improvements or fixes, a release is made and uploaded to [Sourceforget.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/).

If you don't want to wait that long, you can get the latest source code from **Git** and compile it yourself. 

See the following articles for more information:

1. [obtaining the source code from Git](git.md), either book or developer version
2. [compiling the source code](compiling_weka.md)
