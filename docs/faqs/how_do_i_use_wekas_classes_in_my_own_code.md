It's not that hard to use WEKA classes in your own code, the following articles give a good overview of how to do that:

* [Use WEKA in your Java code](../use_weka_in_your_java_code.md)
* [Programmatic Use](../programmatic_use.md)
* In general, the articles tagged as "[source code](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/search.html?q=source+code)".

Further resources:

* Check out the chapter *Using the API* in the Weka manual ([snapshots](../snapshots.md) later than 09/08/2009 and releases >3.6.1 and >3.7.0).
* The [Weka Examples](../weka_examples.md) collection is a an [ANT](../ant.md) project that is available through [snapshots](../snapshots.md) and releases later than 09/08/2009, containing a lot of example classes.
