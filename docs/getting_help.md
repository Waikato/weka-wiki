In addition to consulting the available
[documentation](documentation.md), try searching a mailing list
archive or community forum to check whether a solution to your problem
has already been posted there. Please consult these sources of
information before posting a query on the Weka mailing list or
elsewhere. And please never email individual Weka developers directly.
	  
When you do post a message regarding a problem you encountered with
Weka, please include as much as information as possible. In
particular, consider running Weka with a console window open so that
you can see the entire error output from Java (including the Java
stack trace). This makes it much more likely that you will get useful
help.  When posting questions, comments, or bug reports to the Weka
mailing list, consider the [mailing list
etiquette](https://ml.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka/mailinglist_etiquette.html).
