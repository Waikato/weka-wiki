This wiki is not the only source of information on the Weka
software. Weka comes with built-in help and includes a comprehensive
manual. For an introduction to the machine learning techniques
implemented in Weka, and the software itself, consider taking a look
at the book [Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and
Techniques](https://ml.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka/book.html) and its
freely available [online appendix on the Weka
workbench](https://ml.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka/Witten_et_al_2016_appendix.pdf),
providing an overview of the software. Closely linked to the book,
there are also free [online
courses](https://ml.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka/courses.html) on data
mining with the machine learning techniques in Weka. A list of sources
with information on Weka is provided below.
