This wiki is not the only source of information on the Weka
software. Weka comes with built-in help and includes a comprehensive
manual. For an introduction to the machine learning techniques
implemented in Weka, and the software itself, consider taking a look
at the book [Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and
Techniques](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/book.html) and its
freely available [online appendix on the Weka
workbench](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/Witten_et_al_2016_appendix.pdf),
providing an overview of the software. Closely linked to the book,
there are also free [online
courses](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/courses.html) on data
mining with the machine learning techniques in Weka. A list of sources
with information on Weka is provided below.

	    
# General documentation

* The online appendix [The Weka Workbench](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/Witten_et_al_2016_appendix.pdf), distributed as a free PDF, for the fourth edition of the book [Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/book.html).
		  
* The [manual for Weka 3.8](https://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/weka/WekaManual-3-8-3.pdf?download) and the [manual for Weka 3.9](https://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/weka/WekaManual-3-9-3.pdf?download), as included in the distribution of the software when you download it.
		      
* The [Javadoc for Weka 3.8](https://weka.sourceforge.io/doc.stable-3-8/) and the [Javadoc for Weka 3.9](https://weka.sourceforge.io/doc.dev/), extracted directly from the source code, providing information on the API and parameters for command-line usage of Weka.

* The videos and slides for the online courses on [Data Mining with Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/mooc/dataminingwithweka/), [More Data Mining with Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/mooc/moredataminingwithweka/), and [Advanced Data Mining with Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/mooc/advanceddataminingwithweka/).

# Weka packages

* There is a [list of packages](https://weka.sourceforge.io/packageMetaData/) for Weka that can be installed using the built-in package manager. Javadoc for a package is available at https://weka.sourceforge.io/doc.packages/ followed by the name of the package.

# Mailing list archive

* The [Weka mailing list](https://list.waikato.ac.nz/hyperkitty/list/wekalist@list.waikato.ac.nz/) is a very helpful source of information, spanning more than 15 years of questions and answers on Weka.

# Blogs

* There is the official [Weka blog](https://waikato.github.io/weka-blog/) that has Weka-related news items and the occasional article of interest to Weka users.

* There is also [Mark Hall's blog](https://markahall.blogspot.co.nz/) with a lot of useful information on several important Weka packages in particular.

# Other sources of information

* Weka can be used from several other software systems for data science, and there is a set of slides on [WEKA in the Ecosystem for Scientific Computing](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/WEKA_Ecosystem.pdf) covering Octave/Matlab, R, Python, and Hadoop.

* A page with [with news and documentation on Weka's support for importing PMML models](https://wiki.pentaho.com/display/DATAMINING/PMML+Support+in+Weka).

* A short tutorial on [connecting Weka to MongoDB using a JDBC driver](https://github.com/selvinsource/mongodb-datamining-shell/wiki/Weka-MongoDB).
